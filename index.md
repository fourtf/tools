# some random tools

Here's some tools that I wrote.

## http-log

Opens a http server to which you can send messages.
The messages will be shown in the terminal along the current time.
Debug messages can be passed via the http path or http body.

Install:

```
deno install --allow-net https://fourtf.github.io/tools/http-log.ts
```
